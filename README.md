# NeRF Model Implementation

This project implements the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) model, which creates or predicts a 3D scene of an object using some 2D images.

## Overview

NeRF is a method for representing 3D scenes based on 2D images. It can generate high-quality views of complex 3D scenes by optimizing a continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of 2D images. The original NeRF paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. First, download the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## CUDA and PyTorch

To leverage GPU acceleration with CUDA, ensure you download the correct version of PyTorch compatible with your device's CUDA version. Visit the official PyTorch website and follow the instructions to install the appropriate version.
